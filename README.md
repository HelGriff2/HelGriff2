Hello, I'm Dr Helen Griffin.

My coding journey started in 2002/2003, when I learnt some C-programming as part of a masters course in Genetic Epidemiology.

After completing a mostly lab-based PhD in the Genetics of Congenital Heart Disease (2008), I returned to computational genetics.

I worked as an academic bioinformatician from August 2010, analysing Exome, Genome and bulk-RNAseq sequence data of patients with rare genetic diseases.
Between 2010-2023 I learnt to code with Perl, Bash and R, running analysis on Linux HPC clusters (examples of some old code https://github.com/HelGriff). 

In 2023 I started a new adventure, learning to code with Python in order to apply machine learning techniques.
